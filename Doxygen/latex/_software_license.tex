\end{DoxyEnumerate}

For purposes of clarity, Licensee may N\+O\+T embed the Software on a non-\/\+Microchip Product, except as described in this Section.


\item {\bfseries Documentation License Grant.} \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} grants strictly to Licensee a non-\/exclusive, non-\/transferable, worldwide license to use the Documentation in support of Licensee\textquotesingle{}s authorized use of the Software


\item {\bfseries Third Party Requirements.} Licensee acknowledges that it is Licensee\textquotesingle{}s responsibility to comply with any third party license terms or requirements applicable to the use of such third party software, specifications, systems, or tools. This includes, by way of example but not as a limitation, any standards setting organizations requirements and, particularly with respect to the Security Package Software, local encryption laws and requirements. \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} is not responsible and will not be held responsible in any manner for Licensee\textquotesingle{}s failure to comply with such applicable terms or requirements.


\item {\bfseries Open Source Components.} Notwithstanding the license grant in Section 1 above, Licensee further acknowledges that certain components of the Software may be covered by so-\/called \char`\"{}open source\char`\"{} software licenses (\char`\"{}\+Open Source Components\char`\"{}). Open Source Components means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any license that, as a condition of distribution of the software licensed under such license, requires that the distributor make the software available in source code format. To the extent required by the licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such license will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Components, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Component.


\item {\bfseries Licensee Obligations.} Licensee will not\+: (a) engage in unauthorized use, modification, disclosure or distribution of Software or Documentation, or its derivatives; (b) use all or any portion of the Software, Documentation, or its derivatives except in conjunction with \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} Products, Licensee Products or Third Party Products; or (c) reverse engineer (by disassembly, decompilation or otherwise) Software or any portion thereof. Licensee may not remove or alter any \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} copyright or other proprietary rights notice posted in any portion of the Software or Documentation. Licensee will defend, indemnify and hold \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} and its subsidiaries harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorney\textquotesingle{}s fees), liabilities, and losses, including without limitation\+: (x) any claims directly or indirectly arising from or related to the use, modification, disclosure or distribution of the Software, Documentation, or any intellectual property rights related thereto; (y) the use, sale and distribution of Licensee Products or Third Party Products; and (z) breach of this Agreement.


\item {\bfseries Confidentiality.} Licensee agrees that the Software (including but not limited to the Source Code, Object Code and library files) and its derivatives, Documentation and underlying inventions, algorithms, know-\/how and ideas relating to the Software and the Documentation are proprietary information belonging to \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} and its licensors (\char`\"{}\+Proprietary Information\char`\"{}). Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and will similarly bind its employees and Third Party(ies) in writing. Proprietary Information will not include information that\+: (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by the receiving party independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party\textquotesingle{}s Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure. If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, License will give \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} to object or limit such disclosure. Licensee agrees that the provisions of this Agreement regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure of the Software, Documentation and related Proprietary Rights are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} and its licensors and that monetary damage alone cannot adequately compensate \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} or its licensors if such provisions are violated. Licensee, therefore, agrees that if \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} alleges that Licensee or Third Party has breached or violated such provision then \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} will have the right to injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.


\item {\bfseries Ownership of Proprietary Rights.} \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip} and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the Software and Documentation including, but not limited to all patent, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in the Software, Documentation, and underlying technology and all copies and derivative works thereof (by whomever produced). Licensee and Third Party use of such modifications and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in this Agreement.


\item {\bfseries Termination of Agreement.} Without prejudice to any other rights, this Agreement terminates immediately, without notice by \hyperlink{namespace_microchip}{Microchip}, upon a failure by Licensee or Third Party to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Licensee and Third Party will immediately stop using the Software, Documentation, and derivatives thereof, and immediately destroy all such copies.
